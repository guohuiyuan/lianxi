I like to make friends and I have a lot of friends. We always play together and we make up the small group, so even though my parents are very busy, I am not feeling lonely. Besides my parents, friendship is the most precious thing for me. When I have annoyance, my friends will come to comfort me, we talk a lot and they always find a way to make me forget my sadness. I am so lucky to have those friends. We treat each other as brothers and sisters. No matter how far away I am, I will cherish our friendship. Time will not apart us if we keep in touch.
